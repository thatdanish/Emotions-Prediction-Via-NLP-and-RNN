Statements
i walked out of there an hour and fifteen minutes later feeling like i had been beaten with a stick and then placed on the rack and stretched
i feel try to tell me im ungrateful tell me im basically the worst daughter sister in the world
i feel like im caring about my body not in just an attempt to be the right size but to feel good and have a full life
i know it so difficult especially when you feel you have been wronged
i see the starlight caress your hair no more feel the tender kisses we used to share i close my eyes and clearly my heart remembers a thousand good byes could never put out the embers
